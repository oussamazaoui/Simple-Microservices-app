This microservice is a vital component of a distributed application architecture, serving as the notification hub for various services such as customer management, fraud detection, and other Spring Cloud-based services. It seamlessly integrates with Spring Cloud components like Zipkin for distributed tracing, RabbitMQ for messaging, Eureka for service discovery, and an API Gateway for routing and load balancing.
